# Text extraction from image
Extract all visible text from this image.

**Guidelines:**
- Preserve original formatting where meaningful
- Note text location/context if helpful (e.g., "Header:", "Button text:")
- Indicate unclear or partially visible text with [unclear]
- If multiple text regions exist, organize logically
- Include any numbers, codes, or special characters

Output the extracted text only, no additional commentary.
